# Advanced Shutdown and Restart Scripts
These are simple scripts to give you advanced shutdown options.
## Windows
Made with batchfile in VS Code, takes advantage of the `shutdown` command to let you reboot straight into the UEFI menu, reboot into the Windows Advanced Startup Menu (similar to the recovery menu) and all normal options.
## Linux
This script is a WIP.
